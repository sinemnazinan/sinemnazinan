# Hi there, I'm Sinem! 👋

## About Me
I'm a **4th year Computer Engineering student**. Although my main focus right now is **web development** using **Python/Django**, 
I have a growing interest in both **front-end** and **back-end** technologies. I enjoy exploring various tools and frameworks in full-stack development,
aiming to expand my skill set across multiple areas of software engineering.

In addition to development, I have a keen interest in **software architecture** and **design patterns**, and I'm constantly exploring best practices to improve the structure and quality of my code.

## 📫 How to Reach Me

## 👩‍💻 What I'm Working On
- After a long struggle with **C#**, I'm working on building simple console applications to improve my relationship with the language.
In the future, I plan to integrate what I've learned into projects using the **MVC architecture**, combining it with my C# knowledge.
- Improving my **front-end development** skills by experimenting with responsive design and accessibility in web applications.

## 🚀 Let's Collaborate!
- I’m always excited to collaborate on challenging software projects, especially in areas like **web development** and **object-oriented programming**.
Whether it's a full-stack project or open-source contribution, feel free to reach out if you’d like to work together!
